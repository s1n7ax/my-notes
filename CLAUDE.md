# My Notes - Claude Context

This repository contains my personal notes organized in Markdown files within the `docs/` directory. The notes are categorized into different directories based on topics.

## Structure
- All notes are stored as `.md` files in the `docs/` directory
- Categories are organized as subdirectories (e.g., `Linux/`, `AI/`, `Docker/`, etc.)
- Images and assets are stored in `assets/` directories within relevant sections

## Categories
- **AI**: Machine learning, CUDA, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **AWS**: Cloud services and certifications
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQL concepts
- **Docker**: Containerization and networking
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and CI/CD
- **Linux**: System administration, distributions, tools
- **Programming**: Java, JavaScript, React, Rust, Spring Boot
- **Interview**: Technical interview preparation
- **Self Hosted**: Home server and lab setup

## Usage
- Create new notes as `.md` files in appropriate category directories
- Use relative paths for internal links between notes
- Store images in local `assets/` folders or the main `assets/` directory
